      digital authority: turns out the experts cant expert. everybody is talking, but nobody is making noise.
    true innovation really comes from perpendicular thinking. 
      there is no other way but to re-invent. The only sustainable advantage you can have over others is agility, thatâ€™s it. 
      Because nothing else is sustainable, everything else you create, somebody else will replicate.
